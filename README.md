# Places

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

Places uses the [Moves][1] API to visualize which places you spent the most
time at in the last seven days.

It runs on iOS 7 only and you need to obtain OAuth credentials from
[Moves][2] to use it.
